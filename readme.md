Plugin for adding rich text editing capabilities to textareas in Shortcake.


## Description

Deprecation notice: with the Guttenberg coming into core in a short amount of time, there won't be a need for shortcode UI & it's richtext extension anymore. Everything transitions into blocks and that should be the way to develop moving forward.

This plug-in extends on the capabilities of [Shortcake (Shortcode UI)](https://en.wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-ui/) by adding rich text editing capabilities to textarea inputs in the Shortcake interface, when the specific textarea constructors contain the shortcake-richtext class name.

It uses [TinyMCE](https://www.tinymce.com).


## Installation

You need the latest version of of [Shortcake (Shortcode UI)] installed and activated.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/shortcode-ui-richtext` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Add the meta class option to the textarea input type of an existing shortcake register_for_shortcode call.
4. Due to the possibility of the user entered content to contain special characters like [, ] and ", it is highly recommended to turn on the encode flag as well.
```php
'encode' => true,
'meta'  => array(
	'class' => 'shortcake-richtext',
),
```


## Frequently Asked Questions


### How does an example rich textarea input element shortcake register code looks like?

This is a default shortcode with a single textarea:

```php
shortcode_ui_register_for_shortcode( 'shortcode_name',
	array(
		'label'         => esc_html__( 'Shortcode Name', 'namespace' ),
		'listItemImage' => 'dashicons-text',
		'attrs'         => array(
			array(
				'label' => esc_html__( 'Text Element', 'namespace' ),
				'attr'  => 'text_element',
				'type'  => 'textarea',
			),
		),
	)
);
```

This is the same code with the richtext capability added in on the text_element:

```php
shortcode_ui_register_for_shortcode( 'shortcode_name',
	array(
		'label'         => esc_html__( 'Shortcode Name', 'namespace' ),
		'listItemImage' => 'dashicons-text',
		'attrs'         => array(
			array(
				'label' => esc_html__( 'Text Element', 'namespace' ),
				'attr'  => 'text_element',
				'type'  => 'textarea',
				'encode' => true,
				'meta'  => array(
						'class' => 'shortcake-richtext',
				),
			),
		),
	)
);
```

Outputting requires decoding, and since Shortcake uses url encoding, the attribute powered by the rich text editor needs to be urldecoded before rendering its contents, like in the following example using the `urldecode` [function](http://php.net/manual/ro/function.urldecode.php):

```php
function shortcode_name( $atts ) {
	extract( shortcode_atts(
		array(
			'text_element' => '',
		),
		$atts
	));
	return '<div>' . urldecode( $text_element ) . '</div>';
}
```


### This doesn't work although I added the class according to the instructions. Am I missing anything?

Before submitting a report on the [GitHub Issue tracker](https://github.com/xwp/wp-shortcode-ui-richtext/issues), please ensure the issue you are experiencing does not exist with using the latest Shortcake (Shortcode UI) version downloaded from their own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wp-shortcake/shortcake).
